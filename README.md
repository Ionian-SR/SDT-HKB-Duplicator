# SDT NPC BehBND Script 
This is a python tool that automates the process of adding new 3XXX object entries into a c9997.xml file for an NPC behavior BND for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
This will make it so that if an enemy does not have a certain animation such as 3010, adding it via this tool will allow the game to call it for event and AI scripts.
## USAGE:
- Place your c9997.xml file into this folder.
- Open up a terminal and run "python code.py {aXXX} {3XXX Beginning Range} {3XXX End Range}"

### Examples

- python code.py 0 3010
  - This will generate a singular a000_003010 entry.
- python code.py 1 3000 3005
  - This will generate a100_003000, a100_003001, a100_003002... a100_003005 entries.

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This tool will check if an animation already exists.
- This tool will also check if an animation in a different aXXX category exists.
- This means you can run a000_003000 to a000_003100 if you wanted do with no issues.
- This tool CANNOT add new entries of 3XXX in a specific aXXX category if that category does not exist. (Can't add a100_003000 to an NPC that doesn't even have a100 category)
- Currently will spit out new_c9997.xml after running. This will be annoying to constantly rename, so I will add a proper backup system later.
